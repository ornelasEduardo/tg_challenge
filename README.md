# TG-Challenge

<p>View the Application Running Here: https://ornelaseduardo.github.io/tg_challenge/#</p>

<p>
This is a project built to solve the Tech Gap Solutions challenge. It is an SPA style login page that asks the user for a username and password. The application will output errors to the user in the form of a Sweet Alert informing them of either bad credentials given or missing information. 
</p>

<p>
If credentials are successfully given, the application will make a fetch request to the provided url and endpoints. If the credentials were correct, we should get a response with an Auth token which we'll exchange for profile information. We'll then switch views to a very simplified profile page where the user profile is a card.
